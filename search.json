    "section": "2. Difficulties encountered",
    "text": "2. Difficulties encountered\n\n2.1 Technical and practical issues\nWhile scraping the government data, I ran into several practical difficulties:\n\nFile paths and working directory\nThe script assumes a specific working directory. If RStudio was not set to the project root, the read.csv() and read_json() calls failed with “cannot open file” errors. I fixed this by explicitly setting the working directory and using relative paths like data/... and files/....\nCSV header rows and formats\nThe CSV export from GovInfo includes explanatory header lines before the actual field names. If I did not skip these rows, the data frame loaded incorrectly. Using skip = 2 (as in the template) made the import work reliably. :contentReferenceoaicite:3\nInconsistent or missing links\nNot every record has a clean pdfLink. In some cases, the JSON had missing or NA values, so the code had to be careful about indexing and only trying to download valid URLs.\nDownload reliability and rate limiting\nDownloading multiple PDFs in a row sometimes led to slow responses or temporary failures. The tryCatch() wrapper and a random Sys.sleep() between 1–3 seconds helped handle occasional errors gracefully and kept the script from appearing abusive to the server.\n\n\n\n2.2 How usable is the scraped data?\nThe metadata and PDFs from GovInfo are quite usable, but not “analysis-ready”:\n\nThe JSON metadata provides structured fields such as titles, dates, and committee names, which are very helpful for filtering and organizing hearings.\nHowever, the actual content of the hearings is embedded in PDF documents, which are not directly machine-readable. To analyze the text (for example, topic modeling or sentiment analysis), I would still need to run an additional PDF-to-text extraction step.\nSome records are duplicated across different formats, and their identifiers are not always intuitive, so the user must carefully deduplicate or standardize IDs.\n\nOverall, the scraped data works well for building a corpus of documents, but it requires extra preprocessing before any quantitative analysis.\n\n\n2.3 How the process could be improved\nSeveral improvements could make this workflow smoother and more robust:\n\nUse relative paths and project options\nInstead of hard-coding setwd(\"yourpath\"), it would be better to rely on RStudio Projects or the here package so that the script always starts from the project root, regardless of machine or user.\nFilter and validate links before download\nAdding checks to ensure that pdfLink is not NA and that it starts with https:// would avoid wasted download attempts.\nAutomated logging of errors\nExtending the tryCatch() block to write failed URLs and error messages to a log file would make it easier to re-run only the failed downloads later.\nText extraction and additional data cleaning\nA next step would be to automatically convert the downloaded PDFs to text (using packages like pdftools) and store them as cleaned .txt files. This would make the data much more usable for statistical or text-mining analysis.\nParameterization\nTurning the script into a function where I can pass the committee name, number of documents, and output folder as arguments would make it easier to reuse the code for other committees or topics."

Setting up the file paths correctly, handling messy CSV/JSON exports, and dealing with download errors were the main challenges. Once those issues were resolved, the process of automatically pulling the ten most recent Foreign Relations Committee documents became straightforward, and I now have a reusable template for future government-data projects."

    "text": "3. U.S. Presidential Inaugural Speeches\nThis section uses the code in quanteda_textanalytics02.R.\nThe script analyzes the U.S. inaugural address corpus using wordclouds, keyword-in-context (KWIC), frequency charts, and text scaling.\n\n3.1 Run the script\n\nsource(\"quanteda_textanalytics02.R\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Interpretation\n\nEarly Inaugural Speech Wordclouds\nThe earliest speeches (1789–1826) emphasize terms such as government, duty, public, union, and people.\nThis reflects the period’s preoccupation with defining governmental roles and stabilizing the new republic.\n\n\nComparing Bush, Obama, and Trump Wordclouds\nThe comparison wordcloud shows clear stylistic differences:\n\nBush: terms relating to security, freedom, resolve\n\nObama: focus on hope, unity, responsibility\n\nTrump: “America-first” framing, strong emphasis on national identity\n\nThese terms highlight ideological and rhetorical distinctions between administrations.\n\n\nKWIC + X-Ray Plots\nKWIC searches for words such as “american”, “people”, and “communist” reveal how each term’s use varies by president.\nThe x-ray plot shows that:\n\n“American” appears more frequently in later decades\n\n“People” remains a consistently common term\n\n“Communist” spikes during Cold War speeches\n\n\n\nFrequency Plot for “american”\nThis plot shows the rising use of the term “american” over time.\nIt suggests a growing rhetorical emphasis on national identity throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\n\nKeyness Analysis: Trump vs. Obama\nKeyness identifies words most strongly associated with one president versus the other.\n\nWords with positive keyness → more common in Trump’s speech\n\nWords with negative keyness → more common in Obama’s speech\n\nThis captures stylistic and thematic contrasts between the two presidents."

    "text": "4. What is Wordfish?\nWordfish is an unsupervised text scaling model that estimates:\n\nA latent dimension (e.g., ideology)\nWord discrimination values\nDocument positions on the latent scale\n\nIt uses a Poisson model of word counts:\n\nWords that strongly indicate one side of the scale receive high discrimination values\n\nDocuments containing those words more frequently get shifted toward that side of the latent dimension\n\nThe model is often used to measure:\n\nParty ideology\n\nPolicy stance\n\nRhetorical positioning\n\nIn this assignment’s script, Wordfish is demonstrated using Irish budget speeches, showing how parties and years align on an inferred economic policy dimension."
