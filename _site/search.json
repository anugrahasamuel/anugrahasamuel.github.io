    "section": "2. Difficulties encountered",
    "text": "2. Difficulties encountered\n\n2.1 Technical and practical issues\nWhile scraping the government data, I ran into several practical difficulties:\n\nFile paths and working directory\nThe script assumes a specific working directory. If RStudio was not set to the project root, the read.csv() and read_json() calls failed with “cannot open file” errors. I fixed this by explicitly setting the working directory and using relative paths like data/... and files/....\nCSV header rows and formats\nThe CSV export from GovInfo includes explanatory header lines before the actual field names. If I did not skip these rows, the data frame loaded incorrectly. Using skip = 2 (as in the template) made the import work reliably. :contentReferenceoaicite:3\nInconsistent or missing links\nNot every record has a clean pdfLink. In some cases, the JSON had missing or NA values, so the code had to be careful about indexing and only trying to download valid URLs.\nDownload reliability and rate limiting\nDownloading multiple PDFs in a row sometimes led to slow responses or temporary failures. The tryCatch() wrapper and a random Sys.sleep() between 1–3 seconds helped handle occasional errors gracefully and kept the script from appearing abusive to the server.\n\n\n\n2.2 How usable is the scraped data?\nThe metadata and PDFs from GovInfo are quite usable, but not “analysis-ready”:\n\nThe JSON metadata provides structured fields such as titles, dates, and committee names, which are very helpful for filtering and organizing hearings.\nHowever, the actual content of the hearings is embedded in PDF documents, which are not directly machine-readable. To analyze the text (for example, topic modeling or sentiment analysis), I would still need to run an additional PDF-to-text extraction step.\nSome records are duplicated across different formats, and their identifiers are not always intuitive, so the user must carefully deduplicate or standardize IDs.\n\nOverall, the scraped data works well for building a corpus of documents, but it requires extra preprocessing before any quantitative analysis.\n\n\n2.3 How the process could be improved\nSeveral improvements could make this workflow smoother and more robust:\n\nUse relative paths and project options\nInstead of hard-coding setwd(\"yourpath\"), it would be better to rely on RStudio Projects or the here package so that the script always starts from the project root, regardless of machine or user.\nFilter and validate links before download\nAdding checks to ensure that pdfLink is not NA and that it starts with https:// would avoid wasted download attempts.\nAutomated logging of errors\nExtending the tryCatch() block to write failed URLs and error messages to a log file would make it easier to re-run only the failed downloads later.\nText extraction and additional data cleaning\nA next step would be to automatically convert the downloaded PDFs to text (using packages like pdftools) and store them as cleaned .txt files. This would make the data much more usable for statistical or text-mining analysis.\nParameterization\nTurning the script into a function where I can pass the committee name, number of documents, and output folder as arguments would make it easier to reuse the code for other committees or topics."

    "text": "3. Summary\nThis assignment showed how to move from a search interface on a government website to a reproducible R script that downloads primary documents into a structured project. Setting up the file paths correctly, handling messy CSV/JSON exports, and dealing with download errors were the main challenges. Once those issues were resolved, the process of automatically pulling the ten most recent Foreign Relations Committee documents became straightforward, and I now have a reusable template for future government-data projects."

From these DFMs, users can apply advanced text-analysis methods such as word clouds, keyness comparison, topic modeling, co-occurrence networks, and scaling models such as LSA, Wordfish, and Wordscores. Compared to base R text processing, quanteda makes it faster and more efficient to process large text collections and run reproducible analyses."

Biden–Xi Summit Tweets\nThis section uses the code in quanteda_textanalytics01.R.\nThe script loads tweets about the November 2021 Biden–Xi virtual summit, builds DFMs, performs latent semantic analysis (LSA), and plots hashtag and user networks.\n\n2.1 Run the script\n\nsource(\"quanteda_textanalytics01.R\")\n\nPackage version: 4.3.1\nUnicode version: 14.0\nICU version: 71.1\n\n\nParallel computing: disabled\n\n\nSee https://quanteda.io for tutorials and examples.\n\n\nWarning: package 'readr' was built under R version 4.5.2\n\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.5.2\n\n\nRows: 14520 Columns: 90\n\n\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (50): screen_name, text, source, reply_to_screen_name, hashtags, symbol...\ndbl  (26): user_id, status_id, display_text_width, reply_to_status_id, reply...\nlgl  (10): is_quote, is_retweet, quote_count, reply_count, ext_media_type, q...\ndttm  (4): created_at, quoted_created_at, retweet_created_at, account_create...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Interpretation\n\nLSA (Latent Semantic Analysis)\nThe LSA output shows that tweets cluster into several thematic groups. Based on the most frequent terms in each dimension, the discussions appear to revolve around:\n\nDiplomacy & cooperation (summit, meeting, leaders, virtual talks)\n\nGeopolitical tension (China, security, human rights, Taiwan)\n\nU.S. domestic reactions (journalists, think-tank commentary)\n\nThese clusters reflect how Twitter conversations typically separate into news reporting, political opinion, and geopolitical analysis.\n\n\nHashtag Network Plot\n\ntextplot_network(topgat_fcm, min_freq = 50, edge_alpha = 0.8, edge_size = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hashtag network reveals groups of frequently co-occurring hashtags. For example:\n\nNews-related tags (#Breaking, #US, #China)\n\nPolitical commentary tags (#Biden, #XiJinping)\n\nIssue-specific tags (e.g., related to trade, security, diplomacy)\n\nHashtags that appear close together represent shared topics in the discourse.\n\n\nUser Mention Network Plot\n\ntextplot_network(user_fcm, min_freq = 20, edge_color = \"firebrick\",\n                 edge_alpha = 0.8, edge_size = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis network shows which accounts dominate the conversation. Central users typically include:\n\nJournalists reporting on the summit\n\nNews outlets\n\nPolitical commentators\n\nAnalysts covering U.S.–China relations\n\nThe high degree of clustering indicates that a small number of influential accounts shape much of the discussion."

Comparison: Website vs. gtrendsR\nGoogle Trends Website\n\nVery easy, point-and-click interface.\nAutomatically shows charts and summary statistics.\nExports a single CSV file with one column per keyword.\nGood for quick, one-off exploration.\n\ngtrendsR Package\n\nFully scriptable and reproducible: the code records all settings (keywords, time window, country, etc.).\nReturns a tidy data frame in long format, which is easier to use with packages like dplyr and ggplot2.\nCan be automated or repeated for many different queries.\nOccasionally hits API limits (HTTP 429), which is a practical limitation compared to just using the website.\n\nOverall, the website is best for quick visualization and basic download, while gtrendsR is better for systematic research where we want to re-run the same analysis or combine multiple queries."

    "text": "5. Conclusion\nThis assignment showed two complementary ways to collect data from Google Trends. The website interface makes it simple to explore search interest visually and download a ready-made CSV file. The gtrendsR package requires more setup but gives much more control over the query and produces a tidy, reproducible dataset that fits naturally into an R workflow. For a small class exercise either approach works, but for a real research project I would rely on gtrendsR so that my data collection steps are documented in code and can be updated or repeated whenever Google Trends data change."
